AVOID generating codefiles with more than 300 lines, instead split it amongst several smallerfiles doing tasks collaborating together to do the full functionality.

CREATE WELL COMMENTED code so that it is easy to understand and debug, for very complex functions add a note section above the function in comments to explain it, in a few lines.

make sure the file sturucture is logical.
